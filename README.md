##Project Proposal:
	Develop an android application that allows users a graphical interface to submit and view neighbor and/or neighborhood ratings. The graphical interface will display a map view. The user can then select or zoom into a specific point on the map to view or submit a rating.  The rating will contain a survey from the user with their opinion of the location or neighbor. The scope of this project is limited to the android application graphical interface (front-end). For storing/retrieving the ratings, Firestore cloud database will be used. Firebase auth will be used for user authentication and registration. 

##Justification:
	User perspective: The application would provide helpful information for people moving to a new area. It would also facilitate a non-confrontational method for users to tell their neighbors they are doing something bothersome. 
	Academic perspective: The overall goal is to practice developing an android application, implementing and solidifying what has already been learned. A secondary goal is to learn more about implementing real world SDK’s/API’s using the android platform and google maps.

##Method:
	The application will be developed using Android Studio. The application will utilize the Google Maps SDK/API for android. A formal project plan will be created if the proposal is approved. Progress will be evaluated weekly until the December 5, 2018 due date.
